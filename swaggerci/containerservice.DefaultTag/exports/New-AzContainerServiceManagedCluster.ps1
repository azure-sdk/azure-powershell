COMPLEX PARAMETER PROPERTIES

To create the parameters described below, construct a hash table containing the appropriate properties. For information on hash tables, run Get-Help about_Hash_Tables.

AGENTPOOLPROFILE <IManagedClusterAgentPoolProfile[]>: The agent pool properties.
  Name <String>: Windows agent pool names must be 6 characters or less.
  [ArtifactStreamingProfileEnabled <Boolean?>]: Artifact streaming speeds up the cold-start of containers on a node through on-demand image loading. To use this feature, container images must also enable artifact streaming on ACR. If not specified, the default is false.
  [AvailabilityZone <String[]>]: The list of Availability zones to use for nodes. This can only be specified if the AgentPoolType property is 'VirtualMachineScaleSets'.
  [CapacityReservationGroupId <String>]: AKS will associate the specified agent pool with the Capacity Reservation Group.
  [Count <Int32?>]: Number of agents (VMs) to host docker containers. Allowed values must be in the range of 0 to 1000 (inclusive) for user pools and in the range of 1 to 1000 (inclusive) for system pools. The default value is 1.
  [CreationDataSourceResourceId <String>]: This is the ARM ID of the source object to be used to create the target object.
  [EnableAutoScaling <Boolean?>]: Whether to enable auto-scaler
  [EnableCustomCaTrust <Boolean?>]: When set to true, AKS adds a label to the node indicating that the feature is enabled and deploys a daemonset along with host services to sync custom certificate authorities from user-provided list of base64 encoded certificates into node trust stores. Defaults to false.
  [EnableEncryptionAtHost <Boolean?>]: This is only supported on certain VM sizes and in certain Azure regions. For more information, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/enable-host-encryption
  [EnableFips <Boolean?>]: See [Add a FIPS-enabled node pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools#add-a-fips-enabled-node-pool-preview) for more details.
  [EnableNodePublicIP <Boolean?>]: Some scenarios may require nodes in a node pool to receive their own dedicated public IP addresses. A common scenario is for gaming workloads, where a console needs to make a direct connection to a cloud virtual machine to minimize hops. For more information see [assigning a public IP per node](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools#assign-a-public-ip-per-node-for-your-node-pools). The default is false.
  [EnableUltraSsd <Boolean?>]: Whether to enable UltraSSD
  [GatewayProfilePublicIPPrefixSize <Int32?>]: The Gateway agent pool associates one public IPPrefix for each static egress gateway to provide public egress. The size of Public IPPrefix should be selected by the user. Each node in the agent pool is assigned with one IP from the IPPrefix. The IPPrefix size thus serves as a cap on the size of the Gateway agent pool. Due to Azure public IPPrefix size limitation, the valid value range is [28, 31] (/31 = 2 nodes/IPs, /30 = 4 nodes/IPs, /29 = 8 nodes/IPs, /28 = 16 nodes/IPs). The default value is 31.

This cannot be changed once the AgentPool has been created. This cannot be set on Linux AgentPools. For Linux AgentPools, the driver is selected based on system compatibility.
  [HostGroupId <String>]: This is of the form: /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/hostGroups/{hostGroupName}. For more information see [Azure dedicated hosts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/dedicated-hosts).

    [Type <String>]: The IP tag type. Example: RoutingPreference.
  [NodeInitializationTaint <String[]>]: These taints will not be reconciled by AKS and can be removed with a kubectl call. This field can be modified after node pool is created, but nodes will not be recreated with new taints until another operation that requires recreation (e.g. node image upgrade) happens. These taints allow for required configuration to run before the node is ready to accept workloads, for example 'key1=value1:NoSchedule' that then can be removed with `kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule-`
  [NodeLabel <IManagedClusterAgentPoolProfilePropertiesNodeLabels>]: The node labels to be persisted across all nodes in agent pool.
    [(Any) <String>]: This indicates any property can be added to this object.

  [OSDiskType <OSDiskType?>]: The default is 'Ephemeral' if the VM supports it and has a cache disk larger than the requested OSDiskSizeGB. Otherwise, defaults to 'Managed'. May not be changed after creation. For more information see [Ephemeral OS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#ephemeral-os).
  [OSSku <Ossku?>]: Specifies the OS SKU used by the agent pool. If not specified, the default is Ubuntu if OSType=Linux or Windows2019 if OSType=Windows. And the default Windows OSSKU will be changed to Windows2022 after Windows2019 is deprecated.

  [OrchestratorVersion <String>]: Both patch version <major.minor.patch> and <major.minor> are supported. When <major.minor> is specified, the latest supported patch version is chosen automatically. Updating the agent pool with the same <major.minor> once it has been created will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same Kubernetes version. The node pool version must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor version must be within two minor versions of the control plane version. The node pool version cannot be greater than the control plane version. For more information see [upgrading a node pool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools#upgrade-a-node-pool).
