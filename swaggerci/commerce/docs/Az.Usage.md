Enables you to query for the resource/meter metadata and related prices used in a given subscription by Offer ID, Currency, Locale and Region.
The metadata associated with the billing meters, including but not limited to service names, types, resources, units of measure, and regions, is subject to change at any time and without notice.
If you intend to use this billing data in an automated fashion, please use the billing meter GUID to uniquely identify each billable item.
